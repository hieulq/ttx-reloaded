Just a few days from now, lots of OpenStack community members from
around the world will gather in (hopefully sunny) Santa Clara for the
OpenStack Conference and Design Summit. As I explained
[here](http://www.openstack.org/blog/2011/04/what-to-expect-from-the-conference-and-design-summit/),
those are two co-hosted events, and here are a few precisions on the
Design Summit part.

The Design summit starts on Wednesday at 9am and ends on Friday at 5pm.
Apart from the 25-minute opening plenary, we have three types of
sessions: design discussions, unconference sessions and lightning talks.

*Design sessions* are the meat of the Design Summit. Those 25-minute or
55-minute sessions were selected from proposals coming from developers
working on a feature for future releases of OpenStack. They are
organized in 8 different tracks:

-   OpenStack infrastructure: discussions affecting all the projects
-   Nova APIs: discussions around the OpenStack and EC2 API in Nova
-   Nova volumes: discussions around volumes / block storage in Nova
-   Nova networking: discussions around networking in Nova and the
    proposed Network as a Service project
-   Nova core: other discussions on Nova
-   Glance: discussions on the Glance Image service project
-   Swift: discussions on the Swift Object Storage project
-   Other projects: discussions on OpenStack incubating projects

You can find a tentative schedule, organized by day or track, at the
following URL: <http://summit.openstack.org/ods-d/>. You should expect
it to change by next week though, as we tune it to ensure required
people are present where they are needed. So refresh often !

The second type of sessions in *unconference sessions*. On the Thursday
and the Friday, we'll have an openly-scheduled room available for all
types of presentations or discussions. We'll have a big whiteboard with
empty 30-minute slots: just mark your name and session title in your
preferred time slot. We expect quite a few educational presentations, as
well as discussions around peripheral projects to happen there. So watch
that space !

Finally, from Wednesday to Friday, after lunch and before the design
sessions restart, we'll have 25min of *lightning talks*. These will also
be openly-scheduled, but in 5-minute increments. Anything
loosely-connected to OpenStack is relevant, so step up and use your 5
minutes of glory :)

All the project technical leads and myself hope that this mix of
sessions will allow us to make the most of those three days together.
See you there !
