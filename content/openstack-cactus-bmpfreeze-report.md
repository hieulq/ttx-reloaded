Our [time-based release cycles](http://wiki.openstack.org/ReleaseCycle)
are cadenced by a number of freezes and milestones, and we just
passed [BranchMergeProposalFreeze](http://wiki.openstack.org/BranchMergeProposalFreeze)
for the [Cactus
cycle](http://wiki.openstack.org/CactusReleaseSchedule). Feature
branches should have been proposed by now, so let's see how well we did
compared to the [original plan](http://wiki.openstack.org/releasestatus/)
we had for this release:

-   Essential specs: 3 merged, 2 proposed (100% proposed in time)
-   High-prio specs: 5 merged, 3 proposed, 3 deferred (73%)
-   Medium-prio specs: 11 merged, 5 proposed, 4 late, 2 deferred (73%)
-   Low-prio specs: 7 merged, 1 proposed, 6 late, 2 deferred (50%)

Compared to the [Bexar
cycle]({filename}/openstack-bexar-bmpfreeze-report.md),
the results are comparable (with less success on High specs, better
success on Medium specs). With 54 specs targeted (compared to 42 in
Bexar), that's a great achievement, so congratulations to all the
developers !

Now it's time to concentrate on review and get those proposed branches
merged before [FeatureFreeze](http://wiki.openstack.org/FeatureFreeze),
which happens at end of day March 24.
