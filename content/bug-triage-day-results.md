How did the OpenStack [Bug Triage day we organized
yesterday](http://wiki.openstack.org/BugDays/20120607BugTriage) go ? Did
organizing an event make a difference ? Here are the results !

Nova has more bugs than all the other core projects combined, and the
most slack to clean up. We went from 237 "New" bugs at the beginning of
the day and down to 42, a completion rate of 82%. In the mean time we
managed to close permanently 86 open bugs over a total of 627:

So the BugTriage day definitely made a difference ! Congrats to all the
participants ! It leaves our bug tracker in a lot better shape, and
created a momentum around bug triaging and having an up-to-date database
of known issues.

The success is even more obvious on smaller projects, with Glance,
Keystone and Quantum all managing to complete all
[BugTriage](http://wiki.openstack.org/BugTriage) tasks in the day ! See
for example the results for Quantum:

See you all for our next [BugDay](http://wiki.openstack.org/BugDays)...
which will most likely be a Bug Squashing Day (close as many bugs as
possible) shortly after folsom-2.
