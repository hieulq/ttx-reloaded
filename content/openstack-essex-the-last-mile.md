At the time I'm writing this,Â  we have final release candidates
published for all the components that make up OpenStack 2012.1,
codenamed "Essex":

-   OpenStack Compute (Nova), at
    [RC3](https://launchpad.net/nova/essex/essex-rc3)
-   OpenStack Image Service (Glance), at
    [RC3](https://launchpad.net/glance/essex/essex-rc3)
-   OpenStack Identity (Keystone), at
    [RC2](https://launchpad.net/keystone/essex/essex-rc2)
-   OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon), at
    [RC2](https://launchpad.net/horizon/essex/essex-rc2)
-   OpenStack Storage (Swift) at version
    [1.4.8](https://launchpad.net/swift/essex/1.4.8)

Unless a critical, last-minute regression is found today in these
proposed packages, they should make up the official OpenStack 2012.1
release tomorrow ! Please check out those tarballs for a last check, and
don't hesitate to ping us on IRC (\#openstack-dev @ Freenode) or file
bugs (tagged essec-rc-potential) if you think you can convince us to
reroll.

Those six months have been a long ride, with 139 features added and 1650
bugs fixed, but this is the last mile.
