It's that time of the year again... As we get to the end of our development
cycle, some people look at hard contributions numbers and some companies
decide to expose questionable metrics to brag about being #1.

This cycle, [it's](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2686462/public-cloud/hp-leapfrogs-red-hat-to-become-top-contributor-to-openstack.html) [apparently](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2371470/hp-is-now-the-biggest-contributor-to-openstack-juno) [HP's](https://twitter.com/HPCloudAngel/status/511913478362103810) [turn](https://twitter.com/HPCTOMartinFink/status/512288936819818496).
But you can make numbers say anything... It's true that HP is the largest
contributor when you consider the integrated release, the incubated projects
and the supporting projects altogether, and we are very happy with HP's
involvement in OpenStack. But numbers can always tell a different story
if you look at them from a slightly different angle. If you only consider
commits to the integrated release (the projects that we will end up releasing
as "Juno" in a few weeks), then Red Hat is still #1. If you count code reviews
on this same integrated release, then Mirantis leads. If you only consider
Documentation, then SUSE leads. It's all pretty balanced and healthy.

Rather than celebrating being #1, we should all celebrate the diversity of our
community and our contributors. 132 different organizations were involved.
6% of our code contributions come from individuals who are not affiliated
with any company or organization. The
[Universidade Federal de Campina Grande](http://www.ufcg.edu.br/)
is #25 in commits to OpenStack projects.
[B1 systems](https://www.b1-systems.de/), a small German consulting
firm, is #8, mostly through the work of one person.

Every little bit counts. It doesn't matter who is #1, it matters that we all
*can* contribute, and that we all *do* contribute.
It matters that we keep on making sure *everyone* can easily
contribute. That's what's really important, and I wish we all were celebrating
that.
