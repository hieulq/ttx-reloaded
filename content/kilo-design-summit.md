In less than two months the OpenStack development community will gather in
Paris to discuss the details of the Kilo development cycle. It starts after the
keynotes on the Tuesday of the summit week, and ends at the end of the day on
the Friday. We decided a number of changes in the Design Summit organization in
order to make it an even more productive time for all of us.

## Tuesday

On the Tuesday we'll have **cross-project workshops**. These are 40-min or
90-min sessions on issues that span multiple programs, and where we try to
reach alignment and exploit that little window in time where all projects are
in the same place. These were very successful in Atlanta, so we'll do them
again. We started brainstorming potential topics on
[this etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/kilo-crossproject-summit-topics).

On the same day there will be time for scheduled sessions for incubating
projects, as well as some sessions for other OpenStack projects. I'll post
details on how to participate to that on the
[openstack-dev mailing-list ](http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev) soon.

## Wednesday and Thursday

On Wednesday and Thursday we'll have our usual **scheduled sessions**. Those
are 40-min sessions on a specific theme, and they appear on the Design Summit
schedule. The idea is to use those few visible time slots to gather feedback on
issues that need a lot of external input, but also to address some obvious
elephants in the room.

## Friday

On the Friday we'll have **contributors meetups**. All programs will have
a space for a half-day or a full-day of informal meetup with an open agenda.
The idea is to use that time to get alignment between core contributors on the
cycle objectives, to solve project-internal issues, or have further discussions
on a specific effort. The format is very much like the mid-cycle meetups.

## Program pods

Program pods are roundtables contributors can informally gather around to
continue a discussion when they don't have scheduled space at the same time. In
Paris we have limited space, so there will be a limited number of program pods.
Incubating programs will have a designated pod, but other programs will have to
share the remaining available space. Hopefully it won't be that much of a
musical-chairs issue, thanks to the contributors meetup day on Friday.

## Planning the summit

We decided to abandon the formal *session suggestion* system in favor of a more
collaborative and open approach. Topics are suggested on an open document (see
[the list here](http://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Summit/Planning)), discussed and
deduplicated at IRC team meetings, and finally split between scheduled session
slots and the contributors meetup agenda. This is done under the guidance of
the Kilo PTLs, which we'll be electing soon. Reminders will be posted on the
[openstack-dev](http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev) list.

So I invite everyone to join those documents and the future team meetings
discussing the summit agenda. Let's all make this Design Summit great !
