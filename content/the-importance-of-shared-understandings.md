Slug: the-importance-of-shared-understandings

In his book *Where in the world is my team*, Terence Brake outlines the
three challenges that global and virtual teams face. There is
*Isolation* (reduced contacts and difficulty of trust building can
easily make you feel alone and lose motivation), *Fragmentation*
(unclear purpose and fuzzy responsabilities fragment your effort and
make you inefficient) and *Confusion* (too much or too little
information makes you take the wrong path, and hidden activities prevent
anyone from noticing).

As virtual and global aggregations of common interests, community-driven
open source projects are specifically vulnerable to those challenges.
Fortunately, Brake also explains how to fight these. One of the areas he
identified is convergence, through shared understandings, as a way to
generate clarity and fight confusion (and, to a lesser extent,
fragmentation).

Without shared understandings, the lack of shared context, the
conflicting assumptions, and the distance between team members can
generate a lot of confusion. This confusion results in the loss of
everyone's time in the best case, in team implosion in the worst. With
shared understandings, you get natural convergence and you reduce the
need for interrupt-driven communication.

That's why we, the OpenStack team, need documentation. Not only
user-oriented and developer-oriented documentation, but also project
documentation. The team already has a clear
[mission](http://wiki.openstack.org/StartingPage). Meeting face-to-face
during our design summits allows us to get to know each other, which is
critical to bootstrap common context. We need to ensure we have team
principles (we have [design
tenets](http://wiki.openstack.org/BasicDesignTenets) and [coding
standards](http://wiki.openstack.org/CodingStandards), we need a code of
conduct), clear priorities, open implementation plans, shared
performance indicators... This won't happen in a day.

Since I joined the project, I tried to produce a basic set of reference
documents which should help generating clarity. So far I concentrated on
our release cycle and our Launchpad tools:

-   [Release Schedule](http://wiki.openstack.org/BexarReleaseSchedule)
-   [Release Cycle](http://wiki.openstack.org/ReleaseCycle)
-   [Lifecycle of Bugs](http://wiki.openstack.org/BugsLifecycle)
-   [Lifecycle of
    Blueprints](http://wiki.openstack.org/BlueprintsLifecycle)

Sometimes it looks like those project documentation pages are spelling
the obvious, but that's the price to pay to make sure everyone doesn't
have different assumptions. Those wiki pages are very much open for
discussion and evolution: the goal is not to force anyone into new
workflows or extra bureaucracy. The goal is to have a clear reference
point when you need more clarity. I hope it will help avoiding confusion
by establishing shared understandings.
