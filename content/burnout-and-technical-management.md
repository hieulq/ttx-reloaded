the [slidedeck](http://jonobacon.org/files/jonobacon-burnouttalk.pdf)
for his famous *12 stages of burnout* presentation. I highly recommend
this presentation, especially to technical teams working from home.

I think we are especially vulnerable to burnout, with limited social
interactions and sporadic discussions with our peers and managers. It's
quite easy to fall into the trap of the first two stages, *trying to
prove yourself* and *work harder*. And from there we are vulnerable to
falling into the spiral of the next ten stages.

This highlights one important role of managers of technical teams: to
protect ourselves from this outcome. You shouldn't have to prove
yourself if your manager makes you confident you're in the right place
and you earned your position. You shouldn't have to work harder if your
work output is closely monitored and realistic goals have been set for
you.

Technical managers have lots of duties. They must build their team,
define objectives, ensure that goals are reached, protect their team
from vertical and horizontal organizational hazards... But keeping their
team in shape is one of their most important duties, and detecting and
avoiding burnout in their team is an important part of it.

Your family and your peers can watch your back and help you recover from
it. But a good manager should save you from it.
