### FOSDEM (Brussels, January 31 / February 1st)

I'll be talking about "OpenStack infrastructure tools you'll want to borrow"
in FOSDEM Testing & Automation devroom on Sunday morning. This is a new talk,
presenting the original open source tools created for (and used by) the
OpenStack project infrastructure.
See [details here](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/openstack_infra_tools_to_borrow/). FOSDEM is a free as in freedom *and* beer conference, no need to
register.
