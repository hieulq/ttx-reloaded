It's been a long time since my last blog post... I guess that cycle was
busier for me than I expected, due to my involvement in the Foundation
technical Committee setup.

Anyway, we are now at the end of the 6-month Folsom journey for
OpenStack core projects, a ride which involved more than **330
contributors**, implementing **185 features** and **fixing more than
1400 bugs** in core projects alone !

At release day -1 we have OpenStack 2012.2 ("Folsom") release candidates
published for all the components:

-   OpenStack Compute (Nova), at
    [RC3](https://launchpad.net/nova/folsom/folsom-rc3)
-   OpenStack Networking (Quantum), at
    [RC3](https://launchpad.net/quantum/folsom/folsom-rc3)
-   OpenStack Identity (Keystone), at
    [RC2](https://launchpad.net/keystone/folsom/folsom-rc2)
-   OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon), at
    [RC2](https://launchpad.net/horizon/folsom/folsom-rc2)
-   OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder), at
    [RC3](https://launchpad.net/cinder/folsom/folsom-rc3)
-   OpenStack Storage (Swift) at version
    [1.7.4](https://launchpad.net/swift/folsom/1.7.4)

We are expecting OpenStack Image Service (Glance)
[RC3](https://launchpad.net/glance/+milestone/folsom-rc3) later today !

Unless a critical, last-minute regression is found today in these
proposed tarballs, they should form the official OpenStack 2012.2
release tomorrow ! Please take them for a last regression test ride, and
don't hesitate to ping us on IRC (\#openstack-dev @ Freenode) or file
bugs (tagged *folsom-rc-potential*) if you think you can convince us to
reroll.
