Since the very beginning of OpenStack we fulfilled our [Open
Design](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Open#Open_Design) promise by
organizing a developer gathering open to all OpenStack contributors at
the beginning of all our development cycles, called the [Design
Summit](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Summit). Those events have
proven to be an essential part of OpenStack success and growth.

Design Summits are a set of discussion sessions under the auspices of a
given OpenStack program. There are no formal presentations or speakers,
just open discussions around a given development theme. The elected
Program Technical Leads are responsible for picking a set of discussion
topics, and they take suggestions from the rest of the community on our
session suggestion website at
[summit.openstack.org](http://summit.openstack.org/).

## Improvements

One of the last sessions at the Icehouse Design Summit in Hong-Kong was
about the Design Summit format, and how we should improve on it. Several
issues were reported during that session, like:

-   the inability for technical people to attend (or present at) the
    rest of the OpenStack Summit
-   the (in)visibility of the *Unconference* track, making it difficult
    for nascent projects to attract interested contributors
-   the difficulty to have cross-project discussions in a schedule
    strictly organized around project-specific topics
-   the difficulty for incubated projects to continue to collaborate
    during the week, outside of the limited scheduled slots allocated to
    them

I'm happy to report that we acted on that feedback and will implement a
number of changes in the upcoming Juno Design Summit in Atlanta in May.

First, we started **staggering** the Design Summit from the rest of the
OpenStack Summit. The main event starts on Monday and ends on Thursday,
while the Juno Design Summit starts on Tuesday and ends on Friday. This
should allow our key technical assets to attend *some* of the conference
and maybe present there.

Second, the *Unconference* track is abandoned. It will be replaced by
several initiatives. Part of the *Unconference* was traditionally used
by open source projects related to OpenStack to present themselves and
recruit contributors. We'll have an **Other projects** track at the
Design Summit to cover for those. This will be limited to one session
per project, but those will appear on the official schedule. If you are
an open source project related to OpenStack and would like one of those
slots, please head to the [session suggestion
site](http://summit.openstack.org/) !

Another classic use of the *Unconference* was ad-hoc continuation of
discussions that started in scheduled sessions, or coverage of lesser
topics that couldn't find a place in scheduled sessions. To cover for
that, we'll set up a roundtable for each program (complete with
paperboard) to serve as a rallying point for contributors around that
program. This designated space (codenamed **project pod**) can be used
to have additional discussions and continue collaboration outside of the
limited scheduled sessions.

Last but not least, we'll dedicate the first day of the summit (Tuesday)
to **cross-project workshops**. During that day, no other integrated
project sessions will be running, which should facilitate presence of
key stakeholders. We'll be able to discuss OpenStack-wide goals,
convergence, integration and other cross-project issues.

We hope that those changes will let us make the most of those 4 days all
together. At the end of the Juno Design Summit we'll discuss whether
those changes were an improvement and whether we should do them again
for the K design summit in Paris in November. See you all in Atlanta in
8 weeks!
