In less than a month the OpenStack development community will gather in
Boston for three days of discussions and brainstorming around the Essex
development cycle.

The main part of the summit is the session tracks. The sessions are
proposed by the participants and should generally be about core or
incubated projects. There are three types of sessions:

-   **Brainstorm** sessions (55 min.) are used to discuss and come up
    with a solution for complex issues.
-   **Rubberstamp** sessions (25 min.) are used to present and review an
    already-designed plan. Those should generally be linked to a project
    blueprint.
-   **Discovery** sessions (25 min.) where experts go into deep detail
    into a section of code or feature.

You can already go to <http://summit.openstack.org> and see or file
session proposals. Deadline for proposals is September 27, and the
sooner you propose, the more chances you have to get accepted. The
proposals will be reviewed by the PTLs and myself and, if accepted, will
get scheduled in one of the available time slots. Sessions about
official Core or Incubated projects will get priority.

The other part of the summit is an
[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference): we will have
a whole room dedicated to 55 min. presentations that will be scheduled
directly on big whiteboards at the summit itself. Any presentation on
any subject vaguely related to OpenStack is acceptable ! We'll also have
half-an-hour worth of 5-minute lightning talks after lunch every day,
also scheduled directly at the summit itself on a first come first serve
basis.

See for reference: <http://wiki.openstack.org/Summit>

I hope that this mix of scheduled sessions and unconference style will
allow everyone to make the most of those three days. See you there !
