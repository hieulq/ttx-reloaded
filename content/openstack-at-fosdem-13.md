In 3 weeks, free and open source software developers will converge to
Brussels for 2+ days of talks, discussions and beer.
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2013/) is still the largest gathering for
our community in Europe, and it will be a pleasure to meet again with
longtime friends. Note that FOSDEM attendance is free as in beer, and
requires no registration.

OpenStack will be present with a number of talks in the [Cloud
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/cloud/) in the
*Chavanne* auditorium on Sunday, February 3rd:

-   At 9:30, I'll open the devroom with [**State of the OpenStack Union,
    2013**](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/state_of_openstack/).
    A talk about what happened in the OpenStack development community
    since last year presentation at FOSDEM.
-   At 10:00, don't miss Mark McLoughlin's talk: **[OpenStack: 21st
    Century App Architecture and Cloud
    Operations](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/openstack_app_arch/).**
    He will expose how OpenStack is built with the same resilience and
    automation principles as highly-scalable cloud applications.
-   At 15:00, Rob Clark will detail his [**Security Priorities for Cloud
    Developers**](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/security_priorities/):
    the main security challenges OpenStack faces and what we should do
    about them.
-   At 15:30, Tomas Sedovic will introduce [**Orchestrating complex
    deployments on OpenStack using
    Heat**](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/openstack_heat/). The
    Heat project is in OpenStack incubation currently so this is a great
    opportunity to learn more about it.
-   Finally to close the day at 16:30, Nick Barcet, Eoghan Glynn and
    Julien Danjou will storm the stage and introduce the other OpenStack
    project currently in incubation: [**Measuring OpenStack: the
    Ceilometer
    Project**](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/openstack_ceilometer/).

There will also be OpenStack mentions in various other talks during the
day: Martyn Taylor should demonstrate OpenStack Horizon in conjunction
with [Aeolus Image
Factory](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/image_management/) at
13:30, and Vangelis Koukis will present
[Synnefo](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/synnefo/), which
provides OpenStack APIs, at 14:00.

Finally, I'll also be giving a talk, directed to Python developers,
about the OpenStack job market sometimes Sunday in the [Python
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/track/python/) (room
*K.3.401*): **Get a Python job, work on OpenStack**.

I hope you will join us in the hopefully-not-dead-frozen-this-time and
beautiful Brussels !
