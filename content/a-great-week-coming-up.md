I'm extremely excited by the coming OpenStack Summit week in Paris !

First, well, Paris. It is a pretty amazing city, with great sights, museums and
restaurants. Those who arrived early should have an awesome Saturday, sun all
day, 18°C/65°F high. This is pretty rare in November, so we are very lucky !
Then next week gets cold and wet, so we don't mind being stuck all day in
windowless design summit rooms... Perfect!

Second, this OpenStack Summit is completely sold out _days before_ the event.
That means we managed to get to a critical mass of local/regional community.
That wasn't a given: when we started working on a summit in Paris two years
ago, we were betting on the promising signs that Europe in general, and France
in particular, showed at that time. It feels like we are at the right place
at the right moment after all.

Third, our sponsors and party organizers seem to have outdone themselves. The
bar was set pretty high by previous events. But even if I lived in this city
for a long time, I'm very interested in participating to the pretty exclusive
events that were organized as social events for this week... In particular,
the Tuesday party at Pavillons de Bercy is, in my honest opinion, not something
anyone should miss.

Fourth and finally, 4 years and 10 releases in, OpenStack is at a crossroads.
There is plenty of past to reflect on, and plenty of future to discuss. There
are a number of processes and structures we need to evolve. There are a number
of changes we need to adapt to. I expect this week to be critical in shaping
our future successes: it's therefore pretty important to be around and
participate to the open discussion.

Shameless plug: I'll be moderating a
[panel of old-timers](http://sched.co/1qeOE80) on Wednesday at 9am, to reflect
back on what we achieved, and think about what we failed to achieve in these
last four years. Even if you were at the party the night before, that should
give you a good reason to get up !

So please, all enjoy this great week coming up.
