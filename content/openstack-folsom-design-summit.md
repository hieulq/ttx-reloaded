In a few days the OpenStack developer community will gather in the heart
of San Francisco for three days of brainstorming and discussions around
the next release cycle of OpenStack projects, code-named "Folsom".

The Design Summit is a key moment for our open innovation community.
This is not a conference with speakers. This is not where a closed
developer group announces to the public the changes they intend to push
to their private "open source" project. We design, discuss and make
decisions at the summit as a community. It's quite uncommon, and that's
what makes us different.

Our (elected) PTLs have final say in case of unsolvable conflicts, but
generally consensus is reached in those face-to-face meetings much more
easily than on mailing-lists. That's why this is a critical moment, and
we need to make the best use of this short time together. Connect with
other people interested to solve the same issues, avoid duplication of
work, and collaborate with developers from all those different companies
on making OpenStack awesome.

We have great brainstorming topics for those three days. Most
[tracks](http://wiki.openstack.org/Summit) already have a tentative
schedule posted at <http://folsomdesignsummit2012.sched.org/>, although
it's still subject to scheduling changes. If you have a new idea for a
session, it's too late to get in the official tracks, but we provide an
*Unconference* room for talks that could not fit in the tracks,
last-minute ideas and continuation of discussions. And since we like to
talk about random stuff that matters to us, we will also have 5-min
lightning talks every day after lunch.

Session leads should take the time to view Jim Plamondon's [training
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmY4cK_6NKY), it's a great
introduction on how to make the most of a session you lead. I hope to
meet all of you in person next week !
