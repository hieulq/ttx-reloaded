The 200 open seats for the Essex Design Summit were all registered in
less than 9 days ! If you missed the boat, you can still register on the
waiting list at <http://summit.openstack.org>.

For the last seats we need to give priority to existing OpenStack
developers and upstream/downstream community members, so the waiting
list will be reviewed manually. You will receive an email if you get
cleared and get one of the very last seats for the summit.

Sometime next week, the website should allow registered attendees (as
well as attendees on the waiting list) to propose sessions for the
summit, so stay tuned !
