Next week, the European free and open source software developers will
converge to Brussels for [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/2012/). We took this
opportunity to apply for an OpenStack developers gathering in the
[Virtualization and
Cloud](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom)
devroom.

At 6pm on Saturday (last session of the day), in the Chavanne room, we
will have a one-hour town hall meeting. If you're an existing OpenStack
contributor, a developer considering to join us, an upstream project
developer, a downstream distribution packager, or just curious about
OpenStack, you're welcome to join us ! I'll be there, Stefano Maffulli
(our community manager) will be there, and several OpenStack core
developers will be there.

We'll openly discuss issues and solutions about integration with
upstream projects, packaging, governance, development processes,
community or release cycles. In particular, we'll have a distribution
panel where every OpenStack distribution will be able to explain how
they support OpenStack and discuss what we can improve to make things
better for them.

And at the end of the session we can informally continue the discussion
around fine Belgian beers or their famous
[Carbonade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonade_flamande) !
