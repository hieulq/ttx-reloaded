Open core is a business model where the base version of a software would
be released as open source while some advanced features would be closed
source. It's been under a [lot of
discussion](http://blog.sysdroid.com/2010/06/the-open-core-debate/)
lately, so I'll just add my 2 cents...

Outside the obvious workaround of the free software principles, there
are [well-known
issues](http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=3047&blogid=41)
with this model. In particular, it is difficult to set the right limit
between the "community edition" and the "enterprise edition", and you
end up having to refuse legitimate patches that happen to be a feature
in your enterprise edition roadmap. So building a real open source
community on top of the Open Core model can be quite a challenge. But
the main reason why I think it's wrong is purely technical.

I am a perfectionist. I work on open source software because I truly
believe that the open source development methodology ends up*creating
better code*. Having all your code out there, up for scrutiny and
criticism, makes you think twice before committing something half-baked.
Allowing everyone to scratch their own itch ensures top motivation of
contributors and quick advancement of new features. And I could go on
and on...

Open Core denies that the open source development model creates better
code. Open Core basically screams: for the basics we use open source,
but for the most advanced features, the enterprise-quality ones, closed
source is at least as good. You end up alienating a potential community
of developers for the benefit of writing closed source code of lesser
quality. You end up using open source just as a VC honeypot.

Open Core advocates
[say](http://www.computerworlduk.com/community/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=3048&blogid=41)
that open source software companies need some unfair advantage to
monetize their efforts, and justify Open Core based on that. I'd argue
that selling expertise on a awesome piece of software is a better
business model. It's true it's a longer road to become rich, but I still
think it's the right one.
