Our 2011.2 release, codenamed "Cactus", was finally released early on
April 15. The Diablo merge window opened a few hours later, and in 8
days the developer community will gather in Santa Clara to discuss what
will be in it.

If you want to develop a feature for Diablo and get your design reviewed
or discussed at the summit, remember that you have until the **end of
Tuesday, April 19** to submit a design summit session. The procedure to
follow is simple, please see <http://wiki.openstack.org/Summit> for more
details.

Your session blueprint will be reviewed as soon as possible by the track
leads. Given the very large number of sessions submitted, we might try
to group together related blueprints for a common discussion, or have to
refuse a few sessions. The April 19 is a soft deadline: you can still
submit sessions after that date, but there is no guarantee we will
review it, and they will be given less priority that the ones submitted
early.

See you all there !
