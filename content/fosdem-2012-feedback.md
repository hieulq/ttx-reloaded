I'm back from Brussels, where happened the coldest FOSDEM ever. It
started on Friday night with the traditional beer event. Since the
Delirium was a bit small to host those thousands of frozen geeks, the
FOSDEM organizers had enlisted the whole block as approved bars !

On the Saturday, I spent most of my time in the [Cloud and
Virtualization
devroom](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/virtualization_and_cloud_devroom),
which I escaped only to see Simon Phipps announce the [new
membership-based
OSI](http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2012/02/a-new-osi-for-a-new-decade/index.htm),
and Paolo Bonzini talking about the KVM ecosystem (in a not technical
enough way, IMO). My own [OpenStack talk](http://t.co/8NaehBzT) was made
a bit difficult due to the absence of mike to cover the 550-seat
Chavanne auditorium... but the next talks got one. The highlight of the
day was Ryan Lane's "infrastructure as an open source project"
presentation, about how Wikimedia Labs [uses Git, Gerrit, Jenkins and
OpenStack](http://t.co/aARDOAvY) to handle its infrastructure like a
contributor-driven open source project. The day ended with a good and
frank [discussion between OpenStack developers](http://t.co/lkmsAYFU),
with upstream projects and downstream distributions.

On Sunday I tried to hop between devrooms, but in a lot of cases the
room was full and I couldn't enter, so I spent more time in the hallway
track. I enjoyed Soren's talk about using more prediction algorithms
(instead of simple thresholds) in monitoring systems, introducing his
[Surveilr
project](http://www.surveilr.net/2011/09/15/announcing-surveilr-not-your-average-monitoring-system/).
The highlight of the day was Dan Berrangé's  talk about [using libvirt
to run sandboxed
applications](http://berrange.com/posts/2012/01/17/building-application-sandboxes-with-libvirt-lxc-kvm/),
using virt-sandbox. There are quite a few interesting uses for this, and
the performance penalty sounds more than acceptable.

Overall it was a great pleasure for me to attend FOSDEM this year.
Congratulations to the organizers again. I'll be back next year,
hopefully it will be warmer :)
