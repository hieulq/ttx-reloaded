I'd like to quickly precise what will be expected, from a release
management perspective, from the Project Technical Leads (PTLs) some of
us will nominate and elect in the following weeks.

PTLs, like it says on the tin, will have to technically lead each
project. That comes with a few rights, but also with a lot of duties
that the candidates shouldn't underestimate...

Rights include the ability to decide between conflicting opinions on a
technical debate, or the authority to set the theme for the next
release. Exercising those rights will only be possible if the technical
opinions of the elected lead are widely respected in the project.

Duties of the PTLs, from a release management perspective, mainly
include coming up with a plan for the next release(s). That means
staying on top of what everyone proposes, selecting (and rejecting)
blueprints for a given cycle, setting priorities, approving designs
(potentially with the help of other project drivers), or making sure we
don't duplicate work. The PTLs should also be very impacted by the
design summit preparation, making sure we have sessions for what we need
to discuss, and encouraging people to submit corresponding blueprints.

As release manager, I can help with the process, but the decisions must
come from the PTLs, who have the legitimacy of being elected. During the
cycle, I will then help in making sure the defined plan is on track.

With a well-established project like Swift or a relatively-small project
like Glance, the PTL work can certainly be done at the same time as
regular development. For Nova however, the PTL should expect project
coordination work to take a large part of his time, so he could find
himself not being able to write as much code as he would want. That
should be kept in mind before you accept nominations :)

Hoping this helps in clarifying expectations... Happy nominating and
voting !
